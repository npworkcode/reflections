When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository will be perfect for the situation when I am working at another computer and need to commit the changes to the repository or if another person on a different computer located anywhere in the world, was working on the file, this will help them to make and commit changes directly to the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The code may not be production ready, therefore if there is an automatic pull,
	the code in the repository will not run. Therefore with a manual push, when
	the code is sufficiently tested and working properly. It can be pushed to the repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks is a copy of a another person's repository that is placed in your repository.
	Clones is a copy of another person's reposity that is placed in the local repository.
	Branches is a commit that is made that is not part of master that represents the first
	step of a different line of coding.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This allows a fast forward merge to take place, where any commit made will be an ancestor
	of the last know commit from the remote. Therefore it allows a fast forward merge to take place
	any time in the future.
